Description:      The goal of this project is to improve the ability of students of
                  Elementary French to write down sentences as they hear them. Mastering this
                  ability involves improvements in vocabulary recognition, auditory range
                  and precision, and control of spelling rules. This work emphasizes the role
                  of scheduling in attaining mastery.
Has Study Data:   Yes
Hypothesis:       1. Our initial hypothesis was that exposure to a particular set of sentence
                  would markedly improve the ability to spell these sentences in comparison
                  with a parallel set of unexposed sentences. In the first round of testing,
                  we found that this was wrong, indicating that the skill of dictation is not
                  pegged to sentence level memories, but rather to the level of the phoneme
                  and word.
                  2. We hypothesize that dictation training in French 1 will markedly improve                  3. We hypothesize that the most difficult dictation patterns will be those
                  marked by use of diacritics, unreliable spelling patterns, and difficult
                  auditory sequences.
