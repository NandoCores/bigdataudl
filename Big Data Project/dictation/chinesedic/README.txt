Tutor:            Dictation
Description:      The goal of this project is to improve the ability of students of
                  Elementary Chinese to transcribe Chinese words and phrases in pinyin.
                  This work showed that linking tone perception to full pinyin dictation
                  (along with writing down the correct segments) was not inferior to isolated
                  training on tone.
                  This new work emphasizes the use of minimal pairs as a method of training
                  perception. This method is in line with work on the perception of the
                  English contrast by Japanese speakers However, the current work focuses
                  more specifically on the minimal pair method.
Has Study Data:   Yes
Hypothesis:       1. Learning will be most robust if instruction focuses on the use of
                  minimal pairs.                  2. Mastery training with scheduling is more effective than simple
                  repetition.
